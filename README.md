Fleet management web app

This project complements the routeOptimizer app but it can also be used as a stand-alone fleet management system.

Tech-stack:
	- Angular or angular based frontend;
	- Typescript;
	- GraphQL for live driver-tracking and state management;
	- Perhaps some components lib.;
	- to be determined...

requirements:
	- map integration (mapbox or leaflet or whatever);
	- routeOptimizer backend for optimization, geolocation, processing files etc.;
	- since heroku is caput perhaps is time to learn well aws/azure whatever;
	- github actions pipeline;
	- dokker;
	- I don't know if another backend should be built for this or we can use routeOptimizer entirely. Perhaps is best we refactor and extend what we have???;
	- to be determined...
